# Learning-VHDL
The obective of this repo is to learn VHDL by implementing and testing a MU0 CPU. MU0 is a simple ISA created for educational purposes at the University of Manchester.
This project is based off of Verilog MU0 implementations and testbenches from the Imperial College London second year Electronic and Information Engineering module Instruction Architecture and Compilers, and is authorised by module lecturer Dr David Thomas.
